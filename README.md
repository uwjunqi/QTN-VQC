# QTN-VQC
An Implementation of Quantum Tensor Network for Variational Quantum Circuits

To run the experiments of PCA-VQC and TTN-VQC, please turn to our other repository at https://github.com/uwjunqi/Pretrained-TTN-VQC.git

To simulate the empirical results of QTN-VQC, please run the following command:
```
python qtn_vqc.py
```

Besides, the repo is associated with our new updated paper
